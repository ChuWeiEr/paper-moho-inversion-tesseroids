## Setting up your environment

Download the [Anaconda Python distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads#all).

You'll need to create an separate environment and install the dependencies
that we need.
The commands to do this are programmed in the `Makefile`.
Run:

    make setup

This will create a `conda` environment called `mohoinv` and install all
dependencies on it.
