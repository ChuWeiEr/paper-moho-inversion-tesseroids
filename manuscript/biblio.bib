  abstract = {We present a crustal thickness map of Brazil and adjacent areas based on a compilation of data published in the literature as well as new measurements. We used crustal thicknesses mainly derived from seismic datasets such as deep seismic refraction experiments, receiver function analyses, and surface-wave dispersion velocities. Crustal thicknesses derived from modelling gravity anomalies commonly depend on assumptions, such as constant density contrast across the Moho interface, which are not always easily verifiable and were considered only along the continental shelf to fill large gaps in the seismic data. Our compilation shows that the crust in the stable continental area onshore has an average thickness of 39~\ensuremath{\pm}~5~km (1-\ensuremath{\sigma} deviation) and that no clear difference can be observed between low altitude, intracratonic sedimentary basins, NeoProterozoic foldbelts (except for the Borborema Province), and cratonic areas. The thinnest crust is found in the Borborema Province of NE Brazil (30{\textendash}35~km) and along a narrow belt within Tocantins Province (\ensuremath{\sim}35~km), roughly parallel to the Eastern border of the Amazon craton, while the thickest crust is found in the Amazon and S{\~a}o Francisco cratons (41~\ensuremath{\pm}~4~km), and the Paran{\'a} Basin (42~\ensuremath{\pm}~4~km). Both the Ponta Grossa and the Rio Grande Arches are areas of thinned crust, and the western border of the Brazilian platform, near the sub-Andean region, seems to be characterized by a crustal thickness of less than 40~km. Although sparse in data coverage, we expect the resulting crustal thickness map to be useful for future studies of isostasy, dynamic topography, and crustal evolution of the country.},

  abstract = {An extensive compilation of crustal thicknesses is used to develop crustal models in continental South America. We consider point crustal thicknesses from seismic refraction experiments, receiver function analyses, and surface-wave dispersion. Estimates of crustal thickness derived from gravity anomalies were only included along the continental shelf and in some areas of the Andes to fill large gaps in seismic coverage. Two crustal models were developed: A) by simple interpolation of the point estimates, and B) our preferred model, based on the same point estimates, interpolated with surface-wave tomography. Despite gaps in continental coverage, both models reveal interesting crustal thickness variations. In the Andean range, the crust reaches 75 km in Southern Peru and the Bolivian Altiplano, while crustal thicknesses seem to be close to the global continental average ({\textasciitilde} 40 km) in Ecuador and southern Colombia (despite high elevations), and along the southern Andes of Chile{\textendash}Argentina (elevation lower than 2000 m). In the stable continental platform the average thickness is 38 \ensuremath{\pm} 5 km (1-st. deviation) and no systematic differences are observed among Archean{\textendash}Paleoproterozoic cratons, NeoProterozoic fold belts, and low-altitude intracratonic sedimentary basins. An exception is the Borborema Province (NE Brazil) with crust {\textasciitilde} 30{\textendash}35 km thick. Narrow belts surrounding the cratons are suggested in central Brazil, parallel to the eastern and southern border of the Amazon craton, and possibly along the TransBrasiliano Lineament continuing into the Chaco basin, where crust thinner than 35 km is observed. In the sub-Andean region, between the mid-plate cratons and the Andean cordillera, the crust tends to be thinner ({\textasciitilde} 35 km) than the average crust in the stable platform, a feature possibly inherited from the old pre-Cambrian history of the continent. We expect that these crustal models will be useful for studies of isostasy, dynamic topography, and crustal evolution of the continent.},

The transform of the source geometry for any irregularly-shaped body can be accurately determined by representing the body as closely as possible by a number of prismatic bodies. The Green's function is not dependent upon the source geometry. So the analytical expression for its transform remains the same for all causative bodies. It is, therefore, not difficult to obtain the spectrum of an anomaly by multiplying the transform of the source geometry by that of the Green's function. Then the inverse of this spectrum, which yields the anomaly in the space domain, is calculated by using the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm. Many examples show the reliability and accuracy of the method for calculating potential field anomalies.},

  abstract = {We present a new set of contour maps of the seismic structure of South America and the surrounding ocean basins. These maps include new data, helping to constrain crustal thickness, whole-crustal average P-wave and S-wave velocity, and the seismic velocity of the uppermost mantle (Pn and Sn). We find that: (1) The weighted average thickness of the crust under South America is 38.17 km (standard deviation, s.d.~\ensuremath{\pm}8.7 km), which is \ensuremath{\sim}1 km thinner than the global average of 39.2 km (s.d. \ensuremath{\pm}8.5 km) for continental crust. (2) Histograms of whole-crustal P-wave velocities for the South American crust are bi-modal, with the lower peak occurring for crust that appears to be missing a high-velocity (6.9{\textendash}7.3 km/s) lower crustal layer. (3) The average P-wave velocity of the crystalline crust (Pcc) is 6.47 km/s (s.d. \ensuremath{\pm}0.25 km/s). This is essentially identical to the global average of 6.45 km/s. (4) The average Pn velocity beneath South America is 8.00 km/s (s.d. \ensuremath{\pm}0.23 km/s), slightly lower than the global average of 8.07 km/s. (5) A region across northern Chile and northeast Argentina has anomalously low P- and S-wave velocities in the crust. Geographically, this corresponds to the shallowly-subducted portion of the Nazca plate (the Pampean flat slab first described by Isacks et~al., 1968), which is also a region of crustal extension. (6) The thick crust of the Brazilian craton appears to extend into Venezuela and Colombia. (7) The crust in the Amazon basin and along the western edge of the Brazilian craton may be thinned by extension. (8) The average crustal P-wave velocity under the eastern Pacific seafloor is higher than under the western Atlantic seafloor, most likely due to the thicker sediment layer on the older Atlantic seafloor.},

This procedure is based on a relationship between the Fourier transform of the gravity anomaly and the sum of the Fourier transform of the interface topography. Given the mean depth of the density interface and the density contrast between the two media, the three-dimensional geometry of the interface is iteratively calculated. The iterative process is terminated when either the RMS error between two successive approximations is lower than a pre-assigned value{\textemdash}used as convergence criterion, or until a pre-assigned maximum number of iterations is reached. A high-cut filter in the frequency domain has been incorporated to enhance the convergence in the iterative process. The algorithm is capable of handling large data sets requiring direct and inverse Fourier transforms effectively. The inversion of a gravity anomaly over Brittany (France) is presented to compute the Moho depth as a practical example.},

The main purpose of this paper is to advocate the use of this graph in the numerical treatment of discrete ill-posed problems. The graph is characterized quantitatively, and several important relations between regularized solutions and the graph are derived. It is also demonstrated that several methods for choosing the regularization parameter are related to locating a characteristic L-shaped {\textquotedblleft}corner{\textquotedblright} of the graph.},

  abstract = {We present a new three-dimensional SV-wave velocity model for the upper mantle beneath South America and the surrounding oceans, built from the waveform inversion of 5850 Rayleigh wave seismograms. The dense path coverage and the use of higher modes to supplement the fundamental mode of surface waves allow us to constrain seismic heterogeneities with horizontal wavelengths of a few hundred kilometres in the uppermost 400 km of the mantle.

The large scale features of our tomographic model confirm previous results from global and regional tomographic studies (e.g. the depth extent of the high velocity cratonic roots down to about 200{\textendash}250 km).

Several new features are highlighted in our model. Down to 100 km depth, the high velocity lid beneath the Amazonian craton is separated in two parts associated with the Guyana and Guapore shields, suggesting that the rifting episode responsible for the formation of the Amazon basin has involved a significant part of the lithosphere. Along the Andean subduction belt, the structure of the high velocity anomaly associated with the sudbduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South American plate reflects the along-strike variation in dip of the subducting plate. Slow velocities are observed down to about 100 km and 150 km at the intersection of the Carnegie and Chile ridges with the continent and are likely to represent the thermal anomalies associated with the subducted ridges. These lowered velocities might correspond to zones of weakness in the subducted plate and may have led to the formation of {\textquotedblleft}slab windows{\textquotedblright} developed through unzipping of the subducted ridges; these windows might accommodate a transfer of asthenospheric mantle from the Pacific to the Atlantic ocean. From 150 to 250 km depth, the subducting Nazca plate is associated with high seismic velocities between 5{\textdegree}S and 37{\textdegree}S. We find high seismic velocities beneath the Paran{\'a} basin down to about 200 km depth, underlain by a low velocity anomaly in the depth range 200{\textendash}400 km located beneath the Ponta Grossa arc at the southern tip of the basin. This high velocity anomaly is located southward of a narrow S-wave low velocity structure observed between 200 and 500{\textendash}600 km depth in body wave studies, but irresolvable with our long period datasets. Both anomalies point to a model in which several, possibly diachronous, plumes have risen to the surface to generate the Paran{\'a} large igneous province (LIP).},

The traditional approach to tackling this bias problem is cross-validation. The bootstrap is another way to bring down the high variability of cross-validation. But a direct comparison of the two estimators, cross-validation and bootstrap, is not fair because the latter estimator requires much heavier computation. We performed an empirical study to compare the~.632+~bootstrap estimator with the repeated 10-fold cross-validation and the repeated one-third holdout estimator. All the estimators were set to require about the same amount of computation. In the simulation study, the repeated 10-fold cross-validation estimator was found to have better performance than the~.632+~bootstrap estimator when the classifier is highly adaptive to the training sample. We have also found that the~.632+~bootstrap estimator suffers from a bias problem for large samples as well as for small samples.},

Applying the receiver function technique to determine the crustal structure, there is evidence for an increase of the Moho depth from about 38 km below the Amazon Basin to approximately 48 km north of the basin. In addition, we analyzed the polarization of SKS-waves to determine anisotropy. The observed splitting parameters in a majority of the data set can be accounted for by a layer of axial symmetric anisotropy with the fast direction oriented roughly N110E. This direction cannot be associated with the present-day plate motion of the South American plate. However, the anisotropy may be related to a lithospheric fabric that was generated during the early tectonic history of the Amazonian Craton.},

  abstract = {Geophysics uses gravity to learn about the density variations of the Earth's interior, whereas classical geodesy uses gravity to define the geoid. This difference in purpose has led to some confusion among geophysicists, and this tutorial attempts to clarify two points of the confusion. First, it is well known now that gravity anomalies after the {\textquotedblleft}free-air{\textquotedblright} correction are still located at their original positions. However, the {\textquotedblleft}free-air{\textquotedblright} reduction was thought historically to relocate gravity from its observation position to the geoid (mean sea level). Such an understanding is a geodetic fiction, invalid and unacceptable in geophysics. Second, in gravity corrections and gravity anomalies, the elevation has been used routinely. The main reason is that, before the emergence and widespread use of the Global Positioning System (GPS), height above the geoid was the only height measurement we could make accurately (i.e., by leveling). The GPS delivers a measurement of height above the ellipsoid. In principle, in the geophysical use of gravity, the ellipsoid height rather than the elevation should be used throughout because a combination of the latitude correction estimated by the International Gravity Formula and the height correction is designed to remove the gravity effects due to an ellipsoid of revolution. In practice, for minerals and petroleum exploration, use of the elevation rather than the ellipsoid height hardly introduces significant errors across the region of investigation because the geoid is very smooth. Furthermore, the gravity effects due to an ellipsoid actually can be calculated by a closed-form expression. However, its approximation, by the International Gravity Formula and the height correction including the second-order terms, is typically accurate enough worldwide.},

  abstract = {We have developed a gravity-inversion method for simultaneously estimating the 3D basement relief of a sedimentary basin and the parameters defining a presumed parabolic decay of the density contrast with depth in a sedimentary pack, assuming prior knowledge about the basement depth at a few points. The sedimentary pack is approximated by a grid of 3D vertical prisms juxtaposed in both horizontal directions of a right-handed coordinate system. The prisms' thicknesses represent the depths to the basement and are the parameters to be estimated from the gravity data. To estimate the parameters defining the parabolic decay of the density contrast with depth and to produce stable depth-to-basement estimates, we imposed smoothness on the basement depths and proximity between estimated and known depths at boreholes. We applied our method to synthetic data from a simulated complex 3D basement relief with two sedimentary sections having distinct parabolic laws describing the density-contrast variation with depth. The results provide good estimates of the true parameters of the parabolic law of density-contrast decay with depth and of the basement relief. Inverting the gravity data from the onshore and part of the shallow offshore Almada Basin on Brazil's northeastern coast shows good correlation with known structural features.},

For the computation of the new model GOCO05s more than 800,000,000 observations from 15 satellites are used to estimate about 122,000 gravity field parameters. GOCO05s consists not only of a static field up to degree and order 200, but the temporal variations of the gravity field are modeled as well. These are
represented as regularized trend and annual signal. The main focus in the GOCO combination process is on the proper handling of the stochastic behavior of the data. Therefore, the resulting accuracy information in terms of a full variance covariance matrix is quite realistic and also published with the solution.},

Initially, we obtain a linear approximation stabilized by the total variation functional that correctly maps the horizontal positions of the existing high-angle faults but produced poor estimates of the basin depths. Subsequent iterations update the depth estimates toward the correct values, at the same time preserving the correct fault horizontal positions. Additionally, we stabilize each solution correction by the smoothness constraint without inverting any matrix. The method was substantially more efficient than the nonlinear method, which solves a system of linear equations by the conjugate gradient method at each iteration. For 3000 parameters, it is almost four times faster than the conjugate gradient, and this ratio increased with the number of parameters.},

  doi = {10.1190/1.1444941},
  abstract = {To produce a unique and stable solution in potential-field interpretation, an inversion method must introduce particular constraints. These constraints will inevitably restrict the type of geological setting where the method may be applied. We present a nonmathematical overview of most stabilizing constraints used in inversion methods. Our purpose is to demonstrate that the inversion results are valuable only if the mathematical stabilizing constraints are translated from the geological setting. We identify five basic types of constraints: (1) lower and upper bounds of parameter estimates; (2) proximity of a parameter estimate to a specified value; (3) proximity between pairs of parameter estimates; (4) concentration of the anomalous source about a geometrical element such as an axis; and (5) source compactness. In practice, if used in isolation, constraints (1), (2), (4), and (5) will not produce geologically meaningful results, regardless of the geological setting of the interpretation area. Constraint (3) may produce geologically meaningful results if the anomalous source has a spatially smooth attribute such as the physical property. We illustrate that constraints 1{\textendash}4, if used in isolation, cannot delineate the geometry of a simulated sill intruded into a sedimentary basin. The basic constraints may (and should) be combined in inversion to produce geologically meaningful results. We present two examples of effective constraint combination: (1) proximity to a specific value and mass concentration about an axis (used to delineate the thickness variation of a sill intruded in a sedimentary basin) and (2) inequality, proximity of a parameter estimate to a specified value, and proximity between pairs of parameter estimates (used to map a discontinuous basement relief). Usually, the stabilizing constraints are too restrictive to hold at all points of a given geological environment. In this case, we use different constraints in different sub-areas. Each constraint is based on its compatibility with the actual geology of the subarea.},

  abstract = {Gravity interpretation of large sedimentary basins requires a large number of observations and of parameters estimations, so the development of very efficient gravity inversion methods applicable to such environments is of utmost importance. We found that the highly efficient Bott's method can be cast in the framework of Gauss-Newton's method for minimizing nonlinear functions. Also, we extended Bott's method to (1)~be applicable to sedimentary basins with density contrast between the sediments and the basement decreasing with depth according to different laws, (2)~optimize the modulus of the parameter correction vector, (3)~stabilize the solution by imposing that it be smooth, and (4)~quit the iteration according to an objective and effective criterion. To keep up the efficiency of Bott's method, stable solutions were obtained by applying a moving average to the usually unstable solution obtained at the last iteration. Solutions as efficacious as those obtained by the usual nonlinear method were produced by the present extension at a much smaller computation time. Nonlinear methods, with different implementations for solving a linear system of equations, required between one and two orders of magnitude more time to produce similar solutions using between 2000 and 3000 parameters and observations, for example.},

  abstract = {With the recently available high resolution gravity data from the GOCE satellite a whole range of crustal thickness models have been derived. The added value of GOCE is that it provides data globally, including regions that are poorly covered by seismological studies, like large parts of Africa and South America. Potentially these models can provide new insight in crustal structure for these data poor regions. We compare different models of crustal thickness for South America and Africa and attempt to assess the quality of different modelling techniques and the impact of different data sources. We introduce one new global crustal thickness model based on gravity data, DMM-1, and use seven additional, recently published, continental or global crustal thickness models based on gravity or seismological data. All models use different modelling techniques, and either gravity (four models) or seismological data (four models). We will show that significant differences exist between the models but that these cannot be directly related to the used data. Choices made in the selection and parametrization of the various modelling techniques have more impact than using different data sources including data sources of supposed higher quality. The significant differences, up to 28 km, between models can have a major influence on geodynamical analysis for the two continents. We propose that future work should focus on developing a standard for modelling in data sparse environments, and expanding seismological efforts in those regions that are most different between the shown models to verify the actual crustal thickness. Furthermore, the contribution and inclusion of (satellite) gravity data in crustal thickness models should be further explored.},
